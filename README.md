## Tornado and Global Average Temperature Correlation
Tordado data is from [NOAA](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/tornadoes/)

Global Temperature data is from [datahub](https://datahub.io/core/global-temp#data)

I have combined global average temperature data and tornado count data from two different sources and found strong correlations between global temperature, year, and tornado count.
I have visualized the resulting cleaned and structured data set with [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/david.branson/viz/GlobalTemperatureTornadoFrequencyCorrelation/Dashboard1)
