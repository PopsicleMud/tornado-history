## Tordado data
Tordado data is from [NOAA](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/tornadoes/)

Global Temperature data is from [datahub](https://datahub.io/core/global-temp#data)

This is a work in progress. I have combined global average temperature data and tornado count data from two different sources and found strong correlations between global temperature, year, and tornado count.
My next step will be to visualize the data in Tableau and simplify the data down to a yearly instead of monthly basis.
